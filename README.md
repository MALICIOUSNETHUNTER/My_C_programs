# My_c_programs
Thank you so much, sir, for guiding me on the right path. 
Your support and mentorship have been invaluable in shaping my journey.
This is my GitHub repository, where I’ve uploaded all my programs.
As I mentioned earlier, I’m committed to completing all my syllabus practicals first, and then I’ll be creating some additional programs to showcase my skills. 
Please let me know if there are any errors or areas for improvement!
I will be adding more programs in future!
